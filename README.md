# React Shopping Cart App

This project is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The app simulates a shopping cart where users can add, remove, and view product details. It uses the **Context API** for state management and **React Router DOM** for navigation. The products are fetched from a fake API, powered by `json-server`.
